These folders contain the test cases that I created and tested my design.
You'll need to analyze them to find out what the expected result should be.
You can combine them and test your final product.

Note that if your code pass all of these test cases, it does NOT GUARANTEE that it will pass the test cases that I'll create to test your final product.
